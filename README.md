**Good Morning Developers**

After today, there will be nothing new to learn about Express! Going forward, it's all about putting in repetitions. 

Remember, there are three fundamental capabilities that all web frameworks have in common:
- The ability to define routes used to connect HTTP requests to code ✅
- The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates that include data passed by the controller action ✅
- The ability to process/transform HTTP requests using middleware  ✅

So far this week you’ve written code accomplishing numbers 1 & 2. Today, we'll cover the final capability that Express has to offer - the ability to process/transform HTTP requests using middleware.

Often we want our web servers to do a bit of "processing" with each HTTP request received before the controller functions "do their thing". Examples include:
- Logging requests
- Parsing data payloads sent in the request’s body and make it available to the controller actions (functions)
- Performing authentication
- Etc.

The above processing in Express is performed using middleware functions.

Thus far, we have been able to READ To-Dos in our app, however, we can't go full-CRUD without the use of middleware. During today's lessons we’ll use middleware help us Create, Update & Delete To-Dos!  

### TODAY'S REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. When an Express server is running, what is it waiting/listening for?
2. What does the acronym CRUD stand for?
3. Give two examples of a data resource?
4. What are the only two HTML elements we can use to send HTTP requests to the server?
5. What are the two key parts of an HTTP request that determines what route it will match?
6. We define routes on the server for the purpose of mapping/connecting <what> to <what>?
7. What two HTTP methods can be sent using a <form> tag?
8. Write a hyperlink (`<a>` tag) that when clicked, would result in the user seeing a list of posts (use the RESTful routing convention).

There will be 10 minutes to answer the above questions at the beginning of the lesson but feel free to get a head start!

## Wednesday  

Let's take a moment to review this [guide to adding a feature to a web app](https://github.com/SEI-08-Bahrain/unit_2_project-/blob/main/guide-to-add-feature-to-web-app.md)
